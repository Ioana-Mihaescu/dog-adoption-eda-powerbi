# Dog Adoption EDA (Power BI)

Exploratory Data Analysis of dog adoptions using Power BI.  
This analysis aims to support animal shelters in understanding adoption drivers and improving adoption outcomes.

## Project Overview
This project explores dog adoption patterns using data from the Austin Animal Center.  
The goal was to understand how age, sex, sterilisation status, breed, and time influence adoption outcomes.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Austin Animal Center – Shelter Outcomes  
- **Scope:** Dogs adopted only  
- **Final dataset size:** 84,600 adopted dogs  

## Tools Used
- Power BI  
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation  
- Power BI visuals for exploratory analysis  

## Key Analysis Steps
- Filtered data to dog adoption outcomes only  
- Created age groups (Puppy / Adult / Unknown)  
- Split *Sex upon Outcome* into Sex and Sterilisation Status  
- Analysed adoption trends over time  
- Compared adoption patterns by age, sex, and sterilisation status  
- Identified and corrected data quality issues in breed classification  

## Key Insights
- Puppies are adopted most frequently, but adult dogs represent a significant share of adoptions  
- Adoption volumes dropped sharply in 2020 and recovered in subsequent years  
- Sterilised dogs are adopted at much higher rates than intact dogs, especially adults  
- Mixed-breed dogs dominate adoption outcomes  
- Breed labels require validation against animal type  

## Recommendations
- Promote adult dog adoption campaigns  
- Continue or expand spay/neuter programmes  
- Improve data validation rules for breed and species fields
